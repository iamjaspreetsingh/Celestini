The multiplication and convolution of 2 sparse matrices with N*N dimensions is realized.
Here for multiplication the concept of multiplying and adding the elements if column of first matrix equals row of second matrix.
The row column and value elements are used and an array for each row,column and value of both matrices is made to simplify the solution.
For the convolution of matrices the elements are multiplied in case only when their addition of row no. and column no. separately becomes equal to N.
