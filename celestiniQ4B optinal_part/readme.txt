code for optional part: celastiline2.ino (open with wordpad in case you dont have arduino IDE)
video for the same has also been provided.

OUR Approach:

We are integrating two ultrasonic sensors in order to develop an obstacle detection system.
one sensor will return the x coordinte position of the obstacle while the other sensor will return the y coordinate of the obstacle.
both sensors will be at right angle with respect to eachother in order to obtain (x,y) coordinates.
